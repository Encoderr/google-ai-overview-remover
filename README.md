# Google AI Overview remover extension

This extension is made to remove the annoying Google AI overview that appears when you ask a question or search for anything in the Google search bar. I believe this helps people rely less on AI to find their information, and encourages them to use critical thinking to assess if the information they find is correct or not.

## Installation

At this moment, the extension is not available on any browser extension stores. To install this, you will need to clone the repository, and then load the extension manually in your browser after compressing both background.js and manifest.json into a zip file. DO TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS EXTENSION IS NOT YET VERIFIED SO IT WILL ONLY WORK IN DEVELOPER MODE.

### Possible future features

- Add a logo?
- Publish on Firefox and Chrome extension stores
- Add buttons that can add other inputs to disable the AI Overview, such as cuss words (this is just to be funny)
- Make the searches "hide" the query addons on the search bar so that it does not alter the search result visually.

## Disclaimer

This is the first extension I have made, and it is made to work for Firefox. Hopefully other browsers as well in the future. This extension made for personal use and I am sharing this for those who would want to simplify their google searches without the annoying AI Overview. If anyone has any suggestions or improvements, please let me know by sending me a message! I would love to learn more about making these types of browser extensions as I do not have much experience with it overall.
